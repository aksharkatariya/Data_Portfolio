## About Me
I am an economics and political science student at Ashoka University, Delhi NCT. I am really intrigued by economic development thoeries and try to make sense out of them by looking at various case-studies. I'm also curious about south asian and american contemporary politics. A common thread that runs through my research is the use of data. I try to integrate statistics and data visualizations to give my work an analytical bent. <br />
<br />
Here is my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Q0Icn2PGEAazRZTe9L0rWzIRwTcvM0f/view?usp=sharing) <br />

My interests are :
- Development Economics
- Political Economy
- Data Journalism
- Comparative Politics
- Economic Modelling
- Behavioral Sciences

## Data Analysis Portfolio
### 1. Electoral Data Analysis
I use 2019 Indian election data to analyse 4 unique relationships using various statistical tests of association.  <br />
I have [attached](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AeHu7uYzKqDKcEwwY3LiGKzd_68rxpWP?usp=sharing) the code(R) and the PDF.
[This](https://infogram.com/2019-electoral-data-analysis-1h984wovv7r5z6p?live) is the link to an infographic of the same data I made using infogram.
### 2. Boosting GDP with Electricity
In the summer of 2020, I was interning with the Govt. of Arunachal Pradesh (Office of MLA and Ex. Union Minister Ninong Ering). I found a very high correlation with GDP and Electricity production in that State. I delve further into this associaltion and try to establish a causal relationship between GDP and Electrcity production and find ways to capitalize on it.

I have [attached](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lDzN8FNAKdYPwyI_Zvb9jToX0kC63E7G?usp=sharing) the link to the data analysis report, and my pitch to the MLA. Here is the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vsqB16p-Jo) to the video presentation.

### 3. HDI Dashboard
I created a function which tracks the HDI trajectories of a nation from its first record till present in the form of a line-plot. The data used is sourced from ourworldindata.org

I have [attached](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y57WOsFXxB-gBIN4Q57eYH5Q-HVHnvII?usp=sharing) the code(R).

## Writing Portfolio
### 1. The Macro effects of Microcredit: Prospects in India
This [paper](https://economistsintransition.wordpress.com/2021/03/30/the-macro-effects-of-microcredit-prospects-in-india/) looks at the scope of Microcredit in the Indian context and how India's demographics can be capitalized to improve the Credit-to-GDP ratio. 
### 2. Effect of COVID-19 on the labor market decision of a recent graduaute (January 2021)
In this [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lB2ZnQFdgoK1dBtPpF9vJrXyjxVt16RO/view?usp=sharing), I analyse the impact of the pandemic on the decision-making of a recent graduate using a life-cycle risk microeconomic model. Analysis is done using comparative statics.
### 3. Comparative development analysis of Norway and Finland (December 2019)
This [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sXW_lF0GHITrc6XIsThP4YG9kgQdiWhz/view?usp=sharing) looks at the development trajectories of the two nations -- which were once similar in every aspect -- and answers the puzzle of their divergent growth stories. I also delve into how Norway escaped from the 'Resource Curse' by not developing dependencies on natural resources.
### 4. Capitalism and Pandemics- Beyond Correlation (August 2020)
 I stood 3rd in the article writing competition held by Miranda House, DU in August 2020. I wrote on the relationship between capitalism and pandemics. Here is the [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16pwxRJSMT-INWNAZYoVyGSaZUi3_78Ti/view?usp=sharing) to the article.
### 5. The fall of Airlines; not literally (November 2019)
My [Article](https://ecotalker.wordpress.com/2020/04/19/the-fall-of-airlines-not-literally/) on the airline industry's decline was published on the EcoTalker Blog of Arthashastra Journal.
