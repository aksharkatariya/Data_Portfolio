## My Data Analysis Portfolio
### 1. Electoral Data Analysis
I use 2019 Indian election data to analyse 4 unique relationships using various statistical tests of association  <br />
I have [attached](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AeHu7uYzKqDKcEwwY3LiGKzd_68rxpWP?usp=sharing) the code and the PDF.
### 2. Boosting GDP with Electricity
In the summer of 2020, I was interning with the Govt. of Arunachal Pradesh (Office of MLA and Ex. Union Minister Ninong Ering). I found a very high correlation with GDP and Electricity production in that State. I delve further into this associaltion and try to establish a causal relationship between GDP and Electrcity production and find ways to capitalize on it. Finally, my project was shortlisted and presented to the Power Minister and various other authorities in the state.

I have [attached](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lDzN8FNAKdYPwyI_Zvb9jToX0kC63E7G?usp=sharing) the link to the video presentation, data analysis(R), and my pitch to the MLA. 

### 3. HDI Dashboard
I created a plot which tracks the HDI trajectories of a nation from its first record till present in the form of a line-plot. The data used is sourced from ourworldindata.org
